Welcome to my world of data analysis! Here, I've documented my journey through a series of challenges provided by Codebasics. ðŸš€

As a passionate and dedicated data analyst, I believe in the power of data to unveil insights and drive informed decisions. This repository serves as a testament to my commitment to the craft, showcasing my skills and sharing my experience with fellow data enthusiasts.

## Challenges Overview

In this repository, you'll find a collection of challenges I've taken on from Codebasics. These challenges have allowed me to explore and conquer various aspects of data analysis. The challenge reflects my dedication to mastering the art of extracting valuable insights from data. In this challenge I have analyzed the sales performance of a fictional German beverage 
company named **"CodeX"** and have identified their lacking areas and recommended solutions against them.

## ðŸ’¡ Insights
-  Most customers like their **Compact and Portable Cans** packaging. So, this should be their priority when it comes to packaging.
-  Most customers desire that Codex should reduce their sugary content. Hence, this problem should be considered to increase the sales.
-  Most customers are unable to try it because it is **unavailable in local shops**. So, CodeX should find a supplier for the local market.
-  Most people use CodeX to **stay awake while work or study session**. It means these student and working professional should be the main target of their advertising campaigns.
-  Most people consume to to increase their focus while work. So, it should be the main benefit in their ads.
